I am attending SIAM MDS this week here in Atlanta. [Andreas Robertson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_h1qFBcAAAAJ&hl=en) and I are organizing a [minisymposium](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=80582) on (higher order) stochastic models in materials science and spatial statistics.  
Also check out the presentations by [Stephen](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=139376), [Qi](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=80554), [Christian](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=140040), and [Shreya](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_talk.cfm?p=140238)!
